			<p>Dabke (Arabic: دبكة‎ also spelled Dabka, Dubki, Dabkeh, plural Dabkaat), is an Arab folk dance native to the Levant. Dabke combines circle dance and line dancing and is widely performed at weddings and other joyous occasions. The line forms from right to left and leader of the dabke heads the line, alternating between facing the audience and the other dancers. In English, it can be translated as dabka, dabki, dabkeh.

			"None who heard Reginald Heber recite his ‘ Palestine’ in that magnificent theatre, will ever forget his appearance-so interesting and impressive. It was known that his old father was somewhere sitting among the crowded audience, when his universally admired son ascended the rostrum ; and we have heard that the sudden thunder of applause which then arose so shook his frame, weak and wasted by long illness, that he never recovered it, and may be said to have died of the joy dearest to a parent's heart." —Charles E. Grey on Heber's recital of Palestine at the Sheldonian Theatre.
